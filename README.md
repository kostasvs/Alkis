# Alkis Spaceships
A minigame of laser dogfights in space.

## About
![Preview Gif](preview-gameplay.gif)

The game features spaceship models by [Alkis Tagaras](https://www.artstation.com/alkis-3d) (hence the working title) and music by Georgie Bogie.

Its main purpose was to showcase Alkis' 3D art (which however has improved even more since then, see [his ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/d8lNYK)),
and it was also an opportunity for me to experiment with a cleaner and more structured coding style.

I have open sourced the project as a portfolio piece, and in the hopes that it will be helpful to others. Contributions are always welcome.

## Features

* 75 vs 75 team deathmatch with bots
* Domination-style score system with multipliers
* Customizable controls (with gamepad support)
* Minimalistic menus with animation and sounds

Made with Unity 2019.2. Upon cloning, you should be able to run immediately in Unity test mode, or build and run.

Currently designed for standalone only (Windows/Mac/Linux). Ingame controls can use gamepad, but the menu currently requires a mouse.
